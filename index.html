         <h3>Baseball</h3>
    <p> Over the summer, I played baseball for the Michigan Bulls 17u team. We play games Thursday through Friday every week for six weeks straight. We played against nationally ranked teams and players from all over the country. I did very well and had a lot of college scouts notice me and talk to me about playing baseball in college.

    <div class = "shortText"><h3>Work</h3>
    <p>This summer I worked at Inverness Club and I was a lifeguard and swim team coach there. I met a lot of new people and made some friends from other schools. I worked very little during the middle of summer due to me being out of town all the time for baseball. Other than being out of town, at work I had a lot of fun and I got to make a decent amount of money.
